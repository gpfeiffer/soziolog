Dear #{applicant_first},

Thank you very much for your recent application to the IMS 
asking for support of your conference 
'#{name}'.  
The Committee has now carefully evaluated your application, 
and I regret to have to inform you that 
the IMS will not support your event on this occasion.  

The IMS budget is extremely limited and we had to make 
the difficult decision whether to fund many applications
with very small amounts or to support fewer with reasonable sums.  
Our decision should not be interpreted as a negative view 
on your event for which the IMS wishes you every success.

Best regards,
Goetz Pfeiffer
