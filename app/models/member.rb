    <<LETTER
Dear #{fullname},

I am writing in connection with the renewal of #{acronym}'s institutional
membership of the Irish Mathematical Society. The membership fee for
#{year} is â‚¬#{FEES['I']/100} - I have attached an invoice to that effect.

If you would like to pay by electronic transfer, our bank account
details are as follows:-

Name:      Irish Mathematical Society
Branch:    Bank of Ireland, Maynooth
Sort Code: 901503
A/C No.:   57781485
BIC:       BOFIIE2D
IBAN:      IE47 BOFI 9015 0357 7814 85

As an institutional member, #{acronym} is entitled to nominate up to 10
student members. The current student nominees we have on file are

#{nominees.map(&:name).join("\n")}

Please let me know who you would like to nominate for the coming year
and don't hesitate to contact me with any queries.

With best wishes,
Goetz Pfeiffer
(Treasurer, IMS)
